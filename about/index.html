                        <p>
                            <em>"Jason sold our house for us recently and we couldn't be happier. He gave clear directions on needed updates, great input on managing our tenants through the sales process, and good strategic advice on how to price the house. The property was marketed extremely well and resulted in 150 groups visiting over 3 open houses."</em>

Not only is he an expert in his field, he's also a great guy and a pleasure to work with. I've been at my new place for over a year and I'm loving it. Thanks Jason! I look forward to working with you again in the future."</em>
